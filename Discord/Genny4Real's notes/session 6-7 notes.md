# session 6 notes

we have lunch after the **Lucas Incident** on the ship. Andrew, Arthus and Small Jonas figured out how many supplies we need to get, now SJ is going to buy them. 

we try to get to the shipyard. we encounter some problems with the guards. at the end we manage to get inside the shipyard. 

Master of the Shipyard: **William Goodwill** (not elvish nam?)

we talk to him they have problems with production

they need our help, they will let us learn their magic for reinforce the ships. 

**Paul** it's an half elf, he's the librarian but he's working as an accountant for the shipyard. 

they don't like elves from Moonheaven, because they're very hospitable to foreigners
